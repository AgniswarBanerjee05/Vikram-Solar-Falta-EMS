## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying to Production

#### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Generate strong `FALTA_EMS_JWT_SECRET` (32+ bytes)
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
  ```
- [ ] Generate unique `FALTA_EMS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32+ bytes)
- [ ] Set `ADMIN_REGISTRATION_KEY` to prevent unauthorized admin creation
- [ ] Configure `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Remove all localhost origins from CORS whitelist
- [ ] Add production domain(s) to CORS whitelist

#### Server Configuration
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS (SSL certificate installed)
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security headers
- [ ] Set proper file permissions on database (chmod 600)
- [ ] Disable directory listing
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up proper logging infrastructure

#### Database Security
