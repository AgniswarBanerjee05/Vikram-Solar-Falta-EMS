# 🔧 Quick Fix: Email Not Reaching

## Problem
```
✅ Email sent via Resend to user@email.com: undefined
Mail not reached
```

## Root Cause
You're trying to send from `noreply@vikramsolar.com` which is **NOT verified** with Resend.

## ✅ Immediate Solution (1 Minute)

### Step 1: Update .env File
Open `backend/.env` and change:

```env
# FROM (OLD - Won't Work):
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@vikramsolar.com

# TO (NEW - Works Immediately):
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
```

### Step 2: Restart Servers
```powershell
# Stop all servers (Ctrl+C in each terminal)

# Terminal 1
cd backend/admin-server
npm start

# Terminal 2  
cd backend/user-server
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Again
1. Create a new user
2. Use your real email address
3. Check inbox (might be in spam first time)

## Expected Result
```
✅ Email service configured: Resend API
📧 Sending email via Resend API...
   From: Vikram Solar - Falta EMS <onboarding@resend.dev>
   To: your@email.com
   Subject: Your User Account Has Been Created
✅ Email sent via Resend to your@email.com: msg_abc123xyz789
```

**Email should arrive within 1-2 seconds!**

## 📧 Why This Works

- **onboarding@resend.dev** is Resend's test domain
- Pre-verified and ready to use
- No setup required
- Works instantly

## 🏢 For Production (Later)

To send from your actual domain (`noreply@vikramsolar.com`):

1. Go to: **https://resend.com/domains**
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `vikramsolar.com`
4. Add the DNS records shown:
   - SPF (TXT record)
   - DKIM (TXT record)
5. Wait 15-30 minutes for verification
6. Then update `.env` back to:
   ```env
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@vikramsolar.com
   ```

## 🎯 Still Not Working?

Check these:

### 1. API Key Valid?
- Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
- Check your key is there and active
- Should start with `re_`

### 2. Rate Limit?
- Free tier: 100 emails/day
- Check: https://resend.com/overview
- Wait until tomorrow or upgrade

### 3. Check Resend Dashboard
- Go to: https://resend.com/emails
- See if email appears there
- Check delivery status
