## 🚀 How It Works

### User Account Creation Flow
```
1. Admin creates user via POST /api/users
2. System generates/uses provided password
3. User record saved to database
4. API response sent immediately (non-blocking)
5. Email sent asynchronously in background
6. User receives email with credentials
```

### Admin Account Creation Flow
```
1. Admin registers via POST /api/admin/register
2. Admin record saved to database
3. JWT token generated
4. API response sent immediately (non-blocking)
5. Email sent asynchronously in background
6. Admin receives email with confirmation
```

### Email Delivery Process
```
1. Email module checks for EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD
2. If configured: Creates SMTP transporter
3. If not configured: Logs warning and returns null
4. Email sent with retry logic
5. Success: Message ID logged
6. Failure: Error logged, but doesn't affect API
```
