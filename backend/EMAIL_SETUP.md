## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

**Check Console Output:**
```
Email transporter configured with smtp.gmail.com:587
Email sent to user@example.com: <message-id>
```

**If you see "EMAIL DISABLED":**
- Email credentials are not configured
- Check `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env`

**Gmail "Less Secure App" Error:**
- Don't use your regular password
- Must use an App Password (see Gmail setup above)
- Ensure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled

**SMTP Authentication Error:**
- Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are correct
- Check if your email provider requires app-specific passwords
- Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections on port 587

**Connection Timeout:**
- Check `EMAIL_HOST` and `EMAIL_PORT` are correct
- Try switching between port 587 (TLS) and 465 (SSL)
- Update `EMAIL_SECURE` accordingly

### Email Goes to Spam

- Add a valid `EMAIL_FROM` address
- Use a professional `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`
- Consider using a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Set up SPF/DKIM records for your domain

## Development Mode (Without Email)

If you don't want to configure email during development:

1. **Simply don't set email credentials** - the system will work normally
2. **Check server console** - credentials are logged when accounts are created
3. **Response includes credentials** - the API response contains the user's password

Console output when email is disabled:
```
Email credentials not configured. Emails will not be sent.
[EMAIL DISABLED] Would send to user@example.com: Your User Account Has Been Created
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - it's in `.gitignore` for a reason
2. **Use App Passwords** - don't use your main email password
3. **Rotate credentials** - change email passwords periodically
4. **Limit permissions** - use dedicated email accounts for sending
5. **Monitor usage** - watch for unusual email sending activity
6. **HTTPS only** - ensure dashboard URL uses HTTPS in production

---

## Email Template Customization

The email templates are defined in `backend/shared/email.js`. You can customize:

- **Colors**: Change the gradient colors in the CSS
- **Logo**: Add your company logo in the header
- **Content**: Modify the message text
- **Footer**: Update company information
- **Styling**: Adjust fonts, spacing, and layout

Example customization:
```javascript
// In backend/shared/email.js
const header = {
  background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR_1 0%, #YOUR_COLOR_2 100%)',
  // ... other styles
};
```

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the backend server console for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with Gmail first (easiest to set up)
4. Check your email provider's SMTP documentation
5. Ensure firewall allows outbound SMTP connections

For more help, check the main project README or contact the development team.

## What Happens When Email Fails?

The system is designed to be resilient:

‚úÖ **Account creation still succeeds** - even if email fails  
‚úÖ **Credentials returned in API response** - admin can manually share them  
‚úÖ **Error logged to console** - for debugging  
‚úÖ **User can still log in** - no functionality is blocked

This ensures the system remains functional even with email service outages.
